This document provides a collection of standards for writing modular content to ensure the tenants of modularization are adhered to. By adhering to these guidelines, we can achieve uniformity across all our modular content.

## Global content

The following guidelines pertain to writing tone and voice and are important not only to maintain a consistent feel between lectures but also ensure our curriculum can be consumed by a global audience.

### Latin abbreviations

Avoid Latin abbreviations like e.g. or i.e. Use English language equivalents instead.

### Serial (Oxford) commas

Use the Oxford comma to ensure clarity. For example:

> We went caroling with our dogs, grandma, and grandpa. ***Not:*** We went caroling with our dogs, grandma and grandpa

### Language quirks

Steer clear of idioms, scare quotes, and overly colloquial phrases. They might be misunderstood by native English speakers and can be especially confusing for ESL learners.

Avoid idioms. Even though they are an easy avenue to make writing more playful and fun, they can be hard to understand for some learners.

Avoid words that have multiple meanings and could be easily misunderstood - especially words that can be used as both nouns and verbs.

### Active vs. passive voice

The active voice is a direct way of building sentences, where the subject performs the action. This contrasts with the passive voice, where the subject is acted upon. Here are the key differences between the two:

**Active Voice**
Structure: Subject + Verb + Object
Example: "The team completed the project."
Benefits: Enhances clarity, fosters engagement.

**Passive Voice**
Structure: Object + Form of "Be" + Past Participle + (by + Subject)
Example: "The project was completed."
Usage: Suitable when the action is more important than the doer or when the doer is unknown.

> ⚠️ Americans that speak English as a first language are particularly prone to writing in a passive voice (says the American writing this). You may not even realize you write passively until you're made aware of it. You can substantially improve your writing and also make it more globally accessible by writing in an active voice.

## Timeless modular content

The following guidelines pertain to writing tone and voice and are important not only to maintain a consistent feel between lectures but also ensure our curriculum is long-lived. You should refer to the [Technical Voice](./technical-voice.md) document for most purposes, but some specifics are detailed below.

### AI assistants

Refer to any AI assistant (chatGPT, bard, Copilot, etc.) using the umbrella term *AI assistant*, unless you are referring to a specific model for a specific reason.

### Timeframes

Do not mention any timeframes in content. For example, do not use *this afternoon*, *yesterday*, *tomorrow*, *last week*, etc.

Return to the [top](#contents).

---

### Referencing content

Do not mention any content outside of the current microlesson. Do not mention current, past, or future units. Do not mention labs, even those with a natural association with the module. Do not reference other microlessons within a module, even if it is the same one.

## Link between modules and microlessons

Do not link to content held in other modules, as this defeats the purpose of modularization. The only exception to this is content in the `universal-resources` module.
