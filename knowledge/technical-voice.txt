</h1>

This guide outlines standards for technical writing during the modularization work at GA. It will help you achieve a consistent technical voice. Adhering to these guidelines for all technical modular content ensures a unified content presentation and a seamless transition between lectures for learners.

## Get cozy

Write conversationally. If a sentence sounds formal or distant when read aloud, consider revising it. Aim for a friendly, personable tone. Use contractions. Avoid using Latin abbreviations like e.g., or i.e.

## But not too cozy

Remember, someone else might present your written content. Allow instructors to infuse their style, but avoid jokes that may not resonate with all. Steer clear of idioms, scare quotes, and overly colloquial phrases. They might be misunderstood by native English speakers and can be especially confusing for ESL learners.

## Write inclusively

For guidelines on inclusive writing, refer to the **Inclusivity & Best Practices Guide** in the [General Assembly Brand Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eldhzkHPyS7T2_NCryMm-IFY1gKsxNYY/view) for general guides on writing inclusively. When writing code, also consult the [Technical Style Guide](./technical-style.md).

## We're in it together

Engage the reader as a fellow traveler. Use inclusive language like **let's, we, and us**.

Be empathetic. Foresee the reader's challenges and address them. Never omit steps. If a visual might explain a concept better, discuss this with your team.

Celebrate achievements! ðŸŽ‰

## Get to the point

Prioritize essential information. Structure your writing for easy scanning to aid live lectures. Present crucial details prominently, not buried in larger paragraphs. Keep it simple.

Be concise. Eliminate redundant words or sentences. Avoid unnecessary adverbs, particularly those that are subjective, like "quickly" or "easily."

## Precise but brief

Avoid over-explaining a concept. Get the point across, but don't repeat it.

When possible, use words that have one clear meaning. Words that can act as both nouns and verbs can be easily misunderstood and should be used carefully.

Use one term consistently to represent a concept. Sounding repetitive is preferable to introducing confusion by switching between multiple terms for the same thing.

Start new paragraphs more often than you would in formal writing.

## Impress to connect, connect to impress

Strive to deliver accurate and digestible content. While occasional mistakes are inevitable, unnoticed errors in the curriculum quickly erode trust from both students and instructors. Accurate, smoothly delivered content fosters better connections and makes it easier for instructors to do their jobs.

Don't make potentially controversial changes to the curriculum without bringing a group of other voices into the room.

## Express intent

Our written content should stand alone and be comprehensible without the aid of a video or live presentation. Don't rely on another instructor to read into your writing cues and know to expand on an idea.

If a topic is important enough that the content is incomplete without it, always opt to include it.

## Examine your assumptions

Assume that learners are intelligent and capable of learning, but be careful making any further assumptions. Don't assume they are familiar with technical or business jargon - when using these terms, you should define them.
